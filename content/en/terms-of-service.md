# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (hereinafter referred to as "the Site" or "we"). By accessing or using our services, you agree to these Terms of Service. Please read them carefully before you dive in. 👋

## 1. Service Introduction
**The Site** offers awesome paid subscription content and membership services. These include, but aren't limited to, cool blog articles, exclusive resources, e-books, and lively community interactions. Just a heads-up: some of this good stuff is only for our subscribed users.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- **Users** need a valid email address and a password to set up an account.
- **Users** are responsible for their account's security and everything that happens under it. Seriously, **don't transfer or share your account**! 🚫
- **The Site** can **suspend or terminate** an account if a user breaks these rules. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services** are billed on a monthly or annual basis, and you'll see all the costs upfront on the checkout page.
- **All payments** go through secure third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. Relax, **we don't store your payment info** here. 🔒
- **Subscriptions** will **auto-renew**, so remember to cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up if you don't want to continue.
- **Our 14-day refund policy** is pretty sweet for first-time subscribers! If you're not totally thrilled with the service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just shoot us an email (you'll find it at the end of these terms) and tell us why you're bouncing. Heads up: this is a one-time deal per user. After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo, **we generally don't offer refunds** once payment's made, unless the law makes us. 💸

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- **All original content** is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reposting, or using it for commercial stuff without our permission, okay?
- **Users** get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right** to access our content for personal learning and reading only.
- **For commercial use or if you want to cite a lot**, hit us up to get authorization. ✉️

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Don't you dare** upload, post, or spread anything illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or content that messes with other people's rights. Seriously. 😠
- **No bulk downloading, scraping, or cracking** our member content with any tech tricks. That's a big no-no. 🙅‍♀️
- **The Site** can zap inappropriate content and **ban users who break the rules**. Fair warning!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruption
- **We** can change, pause, or even yank parts or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. Just how it works.
- **The Site** **won't be on the hook for compensation** if our content is temporarily unreachable due to stuff beyond our control, like acts of God, server hiccups, or third-party service outages.

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The info we provide** is just for kicks and giggles (well, reference!). It **definitely isn't** professional advice of any kind (like financial, legal, or medical stuff).
- **The Site** **isn't responsible** for any losses, direct or indirect, that you might suffer from using our content or services. Just keeping it real.

## 8. Governing Law
**These Terms of Service** are governed by, and we'll interpret them according to, the laws of California, USA, ignoring any conflict-of-law principles. If a beef pops up related to these terms, we'll try to chat it out nicely first. If that doesn't work, you're cool with bringing the dispute to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. ⚖️

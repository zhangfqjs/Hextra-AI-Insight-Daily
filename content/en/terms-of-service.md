# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive into our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. Your access or use of the Site means you agree to and accept these terms. Simple as that!

## 1. A Little About Our Services
So, what's the deal here? 🤔 **ai.hubtoday's services** hook you up with paid subscription content and awesome membership perks! Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, cool community interaction, and more. Just a heads-up: some of that good stuff is only for our subscribed users.

## 2. Your Account & Registration
- **To snag an account**, you'll just need a valid email address and to set up a secure password. Easy peasy! 🔒
- **You're totally responsible** for keeping your account safe and for everything that happens under your login. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account with anyone else – that's a big no-no! 🚫
- If things go south and you breach these terms, **we reserve the right** to **suspend or even terminate** your account. Just sayin'!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Our subscription services** are billed either monthly or annually, and you'll see all the costs super clearly laid out on the checkout page. No hidden surprises! 💰
- Don't sweat your financial deets! **All payments** happen securely via trusted third-party platforms (like Stripe and PayPal). We *never* store your payment info on our end. Your security is key! 🛡️
- Heads up: your **subscription will automatically renew**! ✨ Unless you cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up, you'll be charged again. Easy to manage, though!
- **Our 14-Day Refund Policy** is pretty cool for first-timers! If you're not totally thrilled with your subscription within 14 days of purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just hit us up via the email at the bottom of these Terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Oh, and this is a one-time deal per user. After 14 days, or if it's not your first subscription rodeo, **no refunds** will be issued after payment, unless the law specifically says otherwise. Fair's fair! 🔄

## 4. Content & Intellectual Property (IP) 💡
- Here's the deal with our awesome content: **all original stuff on ai.hubtoday** is **copyrighted by us (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reposting, or using it for commercial purposes without getting our green light first! Kinda obvious, right? 😉
- **You're granted** a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** to our content, purely for your personal learning and reading pleasure. So, enjoy it for yourself! 📚
- Wanna use our content commercially or quote us extensively? Awesome! Just **contact us** to get that authorization squared away. 👍

## 5. User Conduct & What's NOT Okay 🙅
- Let's keep it civil, folks! **It's a big no-no** to upload, post, or spread anything illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or that steps on anyone else's rights. Seriously, don't do it. 👎
- Also, trying to **bulk download, crawl, or crack our member content** with technical tricks? Yeah, that's **totally forbidden**. Play fair! 😈
- If you violate these rules, **we absolutely reserve the right** to remove any inappropriate content and **ban your account**. We're not messing around! 🔨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions ⚠️
- Look, things change. So, **we totally reserve the right** to modify, suspend, or even pull the plug on any part or all of our services at any time, without telling you beforehand. It's just how the tech world rolls! 🚀
- Sometimes stuff happens that's out of our control – think natural disasters, server hiccups, or third-party service outages. If our content is temporarily unavailable because of that, **ai.hubtoday isn't liable for compensation**. Just so you know! 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer (The "Don't Blame Us" Part) 😅
- Just to be super clear: **any info ai.hubtoday dishes out** is purely for informational kicks. It's **definitely not** professional advice – so don't treat it like financial, legal, or medical guidance, okay? Always consult the pros! 🧠
- Also, **ai.hubtoday won't be on the hook** for any direct or indirect losses you might face from using our content or services. Use your best judgment! 🙏

## 8. The Legal Stuff (Governing Law) ⚖️
- Alright, let's talk law. **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of California, USA. We're not getting into those tricky "conflict of law" principles here! 🤓
- Got a beef with these Terms? First up, let's try to **chat it out amicably** and find a solution. If we can't sort it out, then you agree to take any disputes to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Consider it a local gathering! 👨‍⚖️
